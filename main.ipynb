    "As a whitewater kayaker, I take many trips to the Chattooga River. The water level is determined by the amount of rainfall in the area. It is important to know the water level of the river before making the trip, because if the water level is too high or too low, the river is not safe to take trips out. The goal of this project is to create a predictive model for the water level of the Chattooga River. This model will be used to predict the water level of the river for the next 24 hours. This will allow for an exploration of how predictive models work, using research to solve a problem, and provide a useful tool for me."

Data is in the form of a text file, listing data about water levels every 15 min."
